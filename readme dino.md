## Overview

**Project Title**:  
Chrome Dino Runner Clone

**Project Description**:  
This project recreates the popular offline Chrome Dinosaur game using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS. The game features a running dinosaur character that must avoid oncoming obstacles (cacti), and it includes animated clouds, ground movement, scoring system, double-jump support, background music, and persistent high score tracking using localStorage.

**Project Goals**:

- Practice JavaScript game loops and animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Handle keyboard input and collision detection
- Implement jump physics and double jump logic
- Add persistent high score with `localStorage`
- Create an engaging, responsive design with audio integration
